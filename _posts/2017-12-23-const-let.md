If you've worked with JavaScript at all you've undoubtedly used the `var` keyword to define variables, but there's now other ways to define variables too: `let` and `const`.

First let's do a quick review of `var`. Two of the key properties of variables
defined with `var` are that:

1) They are scoped to the function in which they are declared, or if there is no
function, the global/window frame.

2) They are hoisted at compile time, meaning that they are allocated in memory
as soon as the script loads.

Here's an example:

```javascript
console.log("before the block myVar equals " + myVar);
if (1 < 2){
  var myVar = "inside an if block";
  console.log("inside the block myVar equals " + myVar);

}
console.log("after the if block myVar equals " + myVar);
```

Output:

```javascript
"before the block myVar equals undefined"
"inside the block myVar equals inside an if block"
"after the if block myVar equals inside an if block"
```

## Variables defined with `let`

You can also define variables using the keyword `let` instead of `var`.
Here's how `let` variables differ from `var`:

1) Thy are scoped to the __block__ in which they are declared. In addition to
functions, this includes things like if statements and while/for loops.

2) They are __not hoisted__ meaning that they do not exist in memory in any way
until the interpreter gets to the line on which they are defined.

Let's look at what happens if you swap out `var myVar` with `let myLet` in the code from above:

```javascript
console.log("before the block myLet equals " + myLet);
if (1 < 2){
    let myLet = "inside an if block";
    console.log("inside the block myLet equals " + myLet);
}
console.log("after the if block myLet equals " + myLet);
```
Output:

```javascript
ReferenceError: myLet is not defined
```

Because let variables are not hoisted, the code chunk error-ed on the first line and will not continue.

Let's skip that first line though and see what we get:

```javascript
if (1 < 2){
    let myLet = "inside an if block";
    console.log("inside the block myLet equals " + myLet);
}
console.log("after the if block myLet equals " + myLet);
```

Output:

```javascript
"inside the block myLet equals inside an if block"
ReferenceError: myLet is not defined
```

Another error, but this time it's after the if block has ended. As you
can see, the `myLet` only existed in the if block. Unlike a `var` variable, it
doesn't exist in any form outside of this block.

In the right circumstances, `let` has several advantages over `var`, such as
performance. Because `let` variables are cleaned up after their block
completes, they're no longer sitting around taking up memory. They're also great
for temporary variables such as in loops, and allow for cleaner code.

Consider the following:

```javascript
var array = [1,2,3];

for (var i = 0; i < array.length; i += 1) {
  console.log(array[i]);
}
console.log("i is still equal to " + i);
```
Output:

```javascript
"1"
"2"
"3"
"i is still equal to 3"
```

We don't think about it, but `i` is still there in memory after the loop
completes, taking up space, and possibly colluding with other loops. If we
define `i` with `let` instead, it will be cleaned up as soon as the loop is
over:

```javascript
var array = [1,2,3];

for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i += 1) {
  console.log(array[i]);
}

console.log("i is now " + i);
```

Output:

```javascript
"1"
"2"
"3"
ReferenceError: i is not defined
```

## Variables defined with `const`

Variables defined with `const` are very similar to `let` variables.

1) Just like `let`, they are scoped to the __block__ in which they are declared.
In addition to functions, this includes things like if statements and while/for
loops.

2) Just like `let`, they are __not hoisted__ meaning that they do not exist in
memory in any way until the interpreter gets to the line on which they are
defined.

3) Variables defined with `const` will throw an error if you attempt to re-
define them.

Here's `const` in action:

```javascript
const name = "Ralph";
console.log("In the global frame the name is " + name);
if (1 < 2){
  const name = "Sam";
  console.log("In this block name is " + name);
}
console.log("Back in the global frame the name is " + name);
const name = "Another name";
```

Output:

```javascript
SyntaxError: Identifier 'name' has already been declared
```

As you can see, because we attempted to redefined `name` in the global namespace, it gave us an error.

There is one cavavet to the idea that `const` variables can't be redefined to be aware of: When the variable is an array or object, the internal elements can still be updated. So the following is still possible:

```javascript
const a = { text: 'Hello' };
a.text = 'Goodbye';
```

__Summary__

| Type | Scope | Hoisting | Other |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|var |function|hoisted|N/A |
|let | block |not hoisted|N/A|
|const|block|not hoisted| error if re-defined|


So there you have it. As always the MDN pages on both [let](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let) and [const](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/const) are great place to go for more information.
