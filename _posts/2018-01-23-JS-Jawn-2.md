# 1: `let` and `const` variables

So far you've always been declaring variables
with the `var` keyword, but there's actually other ways to define variables too:
`let` and `const`.

First let's do a quick review of `var`. Two of the key properties of variables
defined
with `var` are that:

1) They are scoped to the function in which they are declared, or if there is no
function, the global frame.

2) They are hoisted at compile time, meaning that they are allocated in memory
as soon as the script loads.

Here's
an example:

```{.python .input  n=1}
console.log("before the block myVar equals " + myVar);
if (1 < 2){
  var myVar = "inside an if block";
  console.log("inside the block myVar equals " + myVar);

}
console.log("after the if block myVar equals " + myVar);
```

```{.json .output n=1}
[
 {
  "name": "stdout",
  "output_type": "stream",
  "text": "before the block myVar equals undefined\ninside the block myVar equals inside an if block\nafter the if block myVar equals inside an if block\n"
 }
]
```

## let 

You can also define variables using the keyword `let` instead of
`var`.
Here's how `let` variables differ from `var`:

1) Thy are scoped to the __block__ in which they are declared. In addition to
functions, this includes things like if statements and while/for loops.

2) They are __not hoisted__ meaning that they do not exist in memory in any way
until the interpreter gets to the line on which they are defined.

Let's look at what happens if you swap out `var myVar` with
`let myLet` in the
code from above:

```{.python .input  n=2}
console.log("before the block myLet equals " + myLet);
if (1 < 2){
    let myLet = "inside an if block";
    console.log("inside the block myLet equals " + myLet);
}
console.log("after the if block myLet equals " + myLet);
```

```{.json .output n=2}
[
 {
  "ename": "ReferenceError",
  "evalue": "myLet is not defined",
  "output_type": "error",
  "traceback": [
   "evalmachine.<anonymous>:1",
   "console.log(\"before the block myLet equals \" + myLet);",
   "                                               ^",
   "",
   "ReferenceError: myLet is not defined",
   "    at evalmachine.<anonymous>:1:48",
   "    at ContextifyScript.Script.runInThisContext (vm.js:50:33)",
   "    at Object.runInThisContext (vm.js:139:38)",
   "    at run ([eval]:971:15)",
   "    at onRunRequest ([eval]:798:18)",
   "    at onMessage ([eval]:758:13)",
   "    at emitTwo (events.js:126:13)",
   "    at process.emit (events.js:214:7)",
   "    at emit (internal/child_process.js:772:12)",
   "    at _combinedTickCallback (internal/process/next_tick.js:141:11)"
  ]
 }
]
```

Because let variables are not hoisted, the code chunk error-ed on the first line
and will not continue

Let's skip that first line though and see what we get:

```{.python .input  n=3}
if (1 < 2){
    let myLet = "inside an if block";
    console.log("inside the block myLet equals " + myLet);
}
console.log("after the if block myLet equals " + myLet);
```

```{.json .output n=3}
[
 {
  "name": "stdout",
  "output_type": "stream",
  "text": "inside the block myLet equals inside an if block\n"
 },
 {
  "ename": "ReferenceError",
  "evalue": "myLet is not defined",
  "output_type": "error",
  "traceback": [
   "evalmachine.<anonymous>:5",
   "console.log(\"after the if block myLet equals \" + myLet);",
   "                                                 ^",
   "",
   "ReferenceError: myLet is not defined",
   "    at evalmachine.<anonymous>:5:50",
   "    at ContextifyScript.Script.runInThisContext (vm.js:50:33)",
   "    at Object.runInThisContext (vm.js:139:38)",
   "    at run ([eval]:971:15)",
   "    at onRunRequest ([eval]:798:18)",
   "    at onMessage ([eval]:758:13)",
   "    at emitTwo (events.js:126:13)",
   "    at process.emit (events.js:214:7)",
   "    at emit (internal/child_process.js:772:12)",
   "    at _combinedTickCallback (internal/process/next_tick.js:141:11)"
  ]
 }
]
```

Another error, but this time it's on line 5, after the block has ended. As you
can see, the `myLet` only existed in the if block. Unlike a `var` variable, it
doesn't exist in any form outside of this block.

In the right circumstances, `let` has several advantages over `var`, most
notably performance. Because `let` variables are cleaned up after their block
completes, they're no longer sitting around taking up memory. They're also great
for temporary variables such as in loops, and allow for cleaner code.

Consider the following:

```{.python .input  n=4}
var array = [1,2,3];

for (var i = 0; i < array.length; i += 1) {
  console.log(array[i]);
}
console.log("i is still equal to " + i);
```

```{.json .output n=4}
[
 {
  "name": "stdout",
  "output_type": "stream",
  "text": "1\n2\n3\ni is still equal to 3\n"
 }
]
```

We don't think about it, but `i` is still there in memory after the loop
completes, taking up space, and possibly colluding with other loops. If we
define `i` with `let` instead, it will be cleaned up as soon as the loop is
over:

```{.python .input  n=5}
var i = undefined; //resetting from previous example
var array = [1,2,3];

for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i += 1) {
  console.log(array[i]);
}

console.log("i is now " + i);
```

```{.json .output n=5}
[
 {
  "name": "stdout",
  "output_type": "stream",
  "text": "1\n2\n3\ni is now undefined\n"
 }
]
```

## const

Variables defined with `const` are very similar to `let` variables.

1) Just like `let`, they are scoped to the __block__ in which they are declared.
In addition to functions, this includes things like if statements and while/for
loops.

2) Just like `let`, they are __not hoisted__ meaning that they do not exist in
memory in any way until the interpreter gets to the line on which they are
defined.

3) Variables defined with `const` will throw an error if you attempt to re-
define them.

Here's `const` in action:

```{.python .input  n=6}
const name = "Ralph";
console.log("In the global frame the name is " + name);
if (1 < 2){
  const name = "Sam";
  console.log("In this block name is " + name);
}
console.log("Back in the global frame the name is " + name);
const name = "Another name";
```

```{.json .output n=6}
[
 {
  "ename": "SyntaxError",
  "evalue": "Identifier 'name' has already been declared",
  "output_type": "error",
  "traceback": [
   "evalmachine.<anonymous>:8",
   "const name = \"Another name\";",
   "      ^",
   "",
   "SyntaxError: Identifier 'name' has already been declared",
   "    at createScript (vm.js:80:10)",
   "    at Object.runInThisContext (vm.js:139:10)",
   "    at run ([eval]:971:15)",
   "    at onRunRequest ([eval]:798:18)",
   "    at onMessage ([eval]:758:13)",
   "    at emitTwo (events.js:126:13)",
   "    at process.emit (events.js:214:7)",
   "    at emit (internal/child_process.js:772:12)",
   "    at _combinedTickCallback (internal/process/next_tick.js:141:11)",
   "    at process._tickCallback (internal/process/next_tick.js:180:9)"
  ]
 }
]
```

As you can see, because we attempted to redefined `name` in the global
namespace, it gave us an error.

# 2: Closure

As we know, JS has functional scope for variables defined
with `var`. These
variables are scoped to the function they are defined in, and
if they're not
defined inside a function, they're scoped to the global frame.
Nested functions
always have access to outer layers, but outer layers never have
access to inner
layers.

```{.python .input  n=7}
function funcOne() {
  var myString = "This string is defined inside funcOne";
  function writeString() {
    console.log(myString)
  }
  writeString();
}
funcOne();
```

```{.json .output n=7}
[
 {
  "name": "stdout",
  "output_type": "stream",
  "text": "This string is defined inside funcOne\n"
 }
]
```

The code above is nothing you haven't seen before, but let's review what happens
here because we're then going to build on this basic example:

1. `funcOne`
defines a variable, `myString`, and a function, `writeString`.
2. `funcOne` then
calls the `writeString` function.
3. `writeString` simply logs the variable
`myString`. 

Note that `writeString` has access to `myString` automatically
thanks to JS's lexical scoping. `WriteString` doesn't define the variable nor is
it passed in as a parameter.

Let's change to code block above slightly to make use
of closure:

```{.python .input  n=8}
function funcOne() {
  var myString = "This string is defined inside funcOne";
  function writeString() {
    console.log(myString)
  }
  return writeString;
}
var myFunc = funcOne();
myFunc();
```

```{.json .output n=8}
[
 {
  "name": "stdout",
  "output_type": "stream",
  "text": "This string is defined inside funcOne\n"
 }
]
```

Okay, so almost the same code as before, but now instead of `funcOne` defining
and then running `writeString`, it now defines it and _returns_ the function
itself.

That means when we define `myFunc` as the result of `funcOne()`, we're
essentially defining `myFunc` as the `writeString` nested function. Just as in
the first example `writeString` has access to the `myString` variable, but so
does `myFunc`.

The key thing to understand here is that when a function returns another
function that is nested inside of it, you're not only returning the nested
function, you're returning the __context in which the nested function
was
defined__. This is what's know as a closure. This is possible in JS because
functions are _first-class objects_.

Here's a more formal definition that you
may find helpful:

>A closure is the
combination of a function and the lexical environment within which that function
was declared. This environment consists of any local variables that were in-
scope at the time that the closure was created. 

-- [MDN:
Closure](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures)

One of the neat things that closures makes possible is functions that create
other functions, but with the same
initial conditions for every new instance.

```{.python .input  n=9}
var makeAdder = function(a) {
  var adder = function(b) {
  console.log(a + b)
  }
  return adder 
}

var add5 = makeAdder(5);
```

The `a` parameter in the above code has been set to 5 and defined as `add5`. You
can now pass any number to `add5` and it will add 5 to it

```{.python .input  n=10}
add5(2);
add5(7);
```

```{.json .output n=10}
[
 {
  "name": "stdout",
  "output_type": "stream",
  "text": "7\n12\n"
 }
]
```

Thanks to closure we can use the `makeAdder` function to make a completely
different adder:

```{.python .input  n=11}
var add10 = makeAdder(10);
```

Now the `a` parameter has been set to 10 and defined as `add10`.
You can now
pass any number to `add10` and 10 will be added to it

```{.python .input  n=12}
add10(2);
add10(7);
```

```{.json .output n=12}
[
 {
  "name": "stdout",
  "output_type": "stream",
  "text": "12\n17\n"
 }
]
```

Now that's neat and all, but maybe not the most practical example. Let's take a
look at some instances where closures can be quite helpful.

__Private Variables__  
Closures allow you to mimic some of the features of
object-oriented languages that JS lacks on its
own. for example, private values.

```{.python .input  n=13}
var makeCounter = function() {
  var privateCounter = 0;
  function changeBy(val) {
    privateCounter += val;
  };
  return {
    increment: function() {
      changeBy(1);
    },
    decrement: function() {
      changeBy(-1);
    },
    value: function() {
      console.log(privateCounter);  
    }
  }  
};
```

This is very similiar to the other closures we saw above. `makeCounter` defines
an initial variable, `privateCounter`, and a function, `changeBy`, which has
access to `privateCounter`. Instead of returning a single function as we saw
earlier, it actually returns an object which contains 3 functions. Two of these
functions call the `ChangeBy` function, and as a result have access to
`privateCounter` through the magic of closure.

We can now create a new counter
and use any of these methods:

```{.python .input  n=14}
var counter1 = makeCounter();
counter1.increment();
counter1.value();
counter1.increment();
counter1.value();
counter1.decrement();
counter1.value();
console.log(counter1.privateCounter);
```

```{.json .output n=14}
[
 {
  "name": "stdout",
  "output_type": "stream",
  "text": "1\n2\n1\nundefined\n"
 }
]
```

We could then even create anoter counter if we wanted to, and it would not be
affected be the first one, even though they both start with the same initial
value

```{.python .input  n=15}
var counter2 = makeCounter();
counter2.decrement();
counter2.value();
counter2.decrement();
counter2.value();
counter2.decrement();
counter2.value();
```

```{.json .output n=15}
[
 {
  "name": "stdout",
  "output_type": "stream",
  "text": "-1\n-2\n-3\n"
 }
]
```

Notice of course that neither `counter1` or `counter2` has direct access to the
`privateCounter`
variable, if you tried to run
`console.log(counter1.privateCounter)` it would return `undefined`. Instead the
two counter objects have to go through the `value` function. Using closures in
this way is sometimes known the _module pattern_. 

__Exercise__

Write a
function called `makeDamageCounter` that uses closure to return a new function
that can count how much damage a specific adventurer takes during an encounter
with a goblin.   

One of the reasons closure and JavaScript are so closely
associated with each
other is that it's not possible in many other languages:
>In JavaScript, if you use the function keyword inside another function, you are
creating a closure. In C and most other common languages, after a function
returns, all the local variables are no longer accessible because the  stack-
frame is destroyed. In JavaScript, if you declare a function within another
function, then the local variables can remain accessible after returning from
the function you called.

# 3: The `this` Keyword and Constructor Functions


Let's say you create a new
object, fido:

```{.python .input .javascript  n=16}
var fido = {
  name: "fido",
  barkCount: 0     
};
```

You like having fido around so much you decide to create another very similiar
object, lassie:

```{.python .input .javascript  n=17}
var lassie = {
  name: "lassie",
  barkCount: 0     
};
```

This is great and all, but in practice, you probably don't want to be lovingly
handmaking artisnal objects one-by-one; you want some automation. Fortunately we
can create a single constructor function that will take care of that for us:

```{.python .input .javascript  n=18}
var Dog = function(name,barkCount) {
  this.name = name;
  this.barkCount = barkCount;
}
```

With this handy function we can create as many Dog-like obects as we want with:

```{.python .input .javascript  n=19}
var fido = new Dog('fido',0);

console.log(fido);
```

```{.json .output n=19}
[
 {
  "name": "stdout",
  "output_type": "stream",
  "text": "Dog { name: 'fido', barkCount: 0 }\n"
 }
]
```

This may be the first time you've encountered the `this` keyword. It's a
powerful idea that, like most things in JavaScript, has a few quirks to it.

In
JavaScript `this` is a special keyword used inside functions to refer back to
the object/context that invoked the function. Much like the actual English word,
`this` can be thought of sort of like a programming pronoun. Instead of
referring to another noun though, it refers to another object. This is
especially helpful when you want to refer to an object that might not exist yet.
Let's take a look again at that `Dog` function to see what I mean.

```{.python .input  n=20}
var Dog = function(name,barkCount) {
  this.name = name;
  this.barkCount = barkCount;
}

var fido = new Dog('fido',0);
```

The `this` keyword acts as a placeholder. You're saying "whatever new object is
created from running this constructor function, assign it a `name` property
equal to the name parameter, and a `barkCount` property equal to the `barkCount`
parameter". This is helpful because the new object doesn't actually exist yet.
Also don't forget the difference between parameters and properties in these
examples. We use the same name to make them easier to track but they're separate
things:

```{.python .input  n=21}
var Dog = function(fartz_parameter,buttz_parameter) {
  this.name = fartz_parameter;
  this.barkCount = buttz_parameter;
}
```

The above function works just as well as the previous version, it just has more
buttz and fartz in its parameters.

__Exercise__

Write a constructor function
that takes at least two parameters.

The `this` keyword can also be helpful when
assigning functions to an object:

```{.python .input  n=22}
var puppy = {
  name: "fido",
  barkCount: 0,
  bark: function(){
    this.barkCount += 1;
    console.log("barkcount is " + this.barkCount);
  }
}

puppy.bark();
puppy.bark();
```

```{.json .output n=22}
[
 {
  "name": "stdout",
  "output_type": "stream",
  "text": "barkcount is 1\nbarkcount is 2\n"
 }
]
```

## Invocation Rules

In the above example, the `this` in the `bark` function
refers to `puppy`, which is pretty straightforward. There are however instances
when things can get complicated and it can be tough to figure out what object
`this` is pointing to. Let's go over some examples. 

First, just to review
let's look at two straightforward examples again:

Here the `this` in the `bark`
function refers to the `fido` object:

```{.python .input  n=23}
var fido = {
  name: "fido",
  barkCount: 0,
  bark: function(){
    this.barkCount += 1;
    console.log("barkcount is " + this.barkCount);
  }
}
fido.bark();
```

```{.json .output n=23}
[
 {
  "name": "stdout",
  "output_type": "stream",
  "text": "barkcount is 1\n"
 }
]
```

In the next example, `this` refers to the new `puppy` object that's created:

```{.python .input  n=24}
var Dog = function(name,barkCount) {
  this.name = name;
  this.barkCount = barkCount;
}
var puppy = new Dog();
```

So far that's all pretty cut and dry, but what happens when you create a new
object that refers to an existing object's inner functions? 
Let's say for
example that you want to create a new `fido_bark()` function that refers back to
`fido.bark()`

```{.python .input  n=25}
var fido = {
  name: "fido",
  barkCount: 0,
  bark: function(){
    this.barkCount += 1;
    console.log("barkcount is " + this.barkCount);
  }
}
var fido_bark = fido.bark;
fido_bark();
```

```{.json .output n=25}
[
 {
  "name": "stdout",
  "output_type": "stream",
  "text": "barkcount is NaN\n"
 }
]
```

Obviously, that's not what we wanted to happen. What's going on is that the
`this` in the `fido.bark()` function will refer to the next context "up"
whenever it is called. In the case  of `fido_bark()` it would be the the
**Window** (or in a node app, the **Global**) object, which may not be what you
want. 

Although this seem a little confusing, an easy way to think of it is
that generally speaking, the `this` keyword only cares about how it is called,
not how it was defined. In the example above that means that `fido_bark` is in
the global/window context, while `fido.bark` is in the `fido` context.

##
`call` and `apply`

Fortunately you can avoid the issue above by using the
`call` and `apply` functions, which allow you to explicitly set which context
you which to run code:

```{.python .input  n=26}
var fido = {
  name: "fido",
  barkCount: 0,
  bark: function(){
    this.barkCount += 1;
    console.log("barkcount is " + this.barkCount);
  }
}

var fido_bark = fido.bark;
fido_bark.call(fido);
```

```{.json .output n=26}
[
 {
  "name": "stdout",
  "output_type": "stream",
  "text": "barkcount is 1\n"
 }
]
```

As you can see, we're manually telling the `bark` function that we want it to
run with the context of `fido`, rather than Global, which is what it would use
by default.

If the `fido_bark` function took any parameters you could pass them
in after the first object:

`fido_bark.call(fido,one_parameter,two_parameter);`
`apply` is very similar to `call`, the chief difference is that instead of
passing in any needed parameters as comma separated list you pass them in as an
array.

`fido_bark.apply(fido,[one_parameter,two_parameter]);`

__Exercise__

1. Write a new function, `hi` that logs the line `"Hello, my name
is " + this.name` 
2. Create two new objects with a `name` property, `Joe` and
`Shmoe`.
3. Use `call` to run `hi` for each object.

## `bind`

As you can see, `call`/`apply` help you avoid some issues with
`this`. One downside with them though is that you have to specify the proper
context every time you call a function with them. This can end up being a bit
verbose and redundant over time. Fortunately, `bind` can be used to help with
this issue. It's used to permanently set the context of a function ahead of
time, for invocation later on:

```{.python .input  n=27}
var fido = {
  name: "fido",
  bark: function () {
  console.log("My name is  " + this.name);
  }
}

var fido_bark = fido.bark.bind(fido);
fido_bark();
```

```{.json .output n=27}
[
 {
  "name": "stdout",
  "output_type": "stream",
  "text": "My name is  fido\n"
 }
]
```

```{.python .input  n=28}
var bingo = {
  name: "bingo"
}

bingo.bark = fido.bark.bind(bingo);
bingo.bark();
```

```{.json .output n=28}
[
 {
  "name": "stdout",
  "output_type": "stream",
  "text": "My name is  bingo\n"
 }
]
```

So as you can see, using `call` or `apply` invokes the `bark` function right
away, but `bind` is used to create a new function with the proper context
permanently set. This technique is sometimes called "function borrowing".

__Exercise__

Using your code from the `call` exercise above, Use `bind` to
create two dedicated functions `hiJoe` and `hiShmoe` that run the `hi` function
for each of those objects.

# 4: Inheritance

Inheritance is a key concept in any object-oriented
programming language. Although the implementation details can vary considerably
from language to language, the essential idea behind inheritance is relatively
simple: message delegation. The following quote from Sandi Metz's _Practical
Object-Oriented Design_ sums it up pretty succinctly:

> Inheritance is, at its
core, a mechanism for automatic message delegation. It defines a forwarding path
for not-understood messages. It creates relationships such that, if one object
cannot respond to a received message, it delegates that message to another.(106)
This is the core of what inheritance is all about. If one object doesn't know
how to respond to a property or method call, we check its parent object, if the
parent object doesn't know how to respond, we check the next level up, and so on
and so on. As we'll see today, the actual implementation details can get pretty
complex pretty quickly, but it's important to keep in mind that the core of this
concept is relatively straightforward.

## Classical vs. Prototypal Inheritance
Class-based inheritance systems are much more common than prototypal systems, so
it might be helpful to quickly distinguish the two. Let's review classical
inheritance briefly and then contrast it with a prototypal system. 

###
Classical Inheritance

Class-based object-oriented languages, such as Ruby or
Python, primarily use two main types of abstractions to represent the world:
-
objects: A specific instance of something. An email, a cake, a customer help
request, etc.
- classes: A generalization of a type of object. They hold shared
properties and functions common to all of those objects. 

In Ruby all objects
belong to a class, from which they inherit properties and methods. Classes in
turn can inherit things from another class. This hierarchy of `class -> subclass
-> object` creates what's known as a _inheritance chain_ or _inheritance path_.
Let's take a look at this concept using the example of cake. Say I have an ice
cream cake in the freezer, we'll refer to it as `myBirtdayCake`. This specific
cake is an instance of the `IceCreamCake` class. It shares certain basic
properties that all members of the `IceCreamCake` have in common. The
`IceCreamCake` class is in turn actually a subclass of the larger `Cake` class,
as it inherits many properties from that superclass.

| Name | Type | Comments |
| :--- | :--- | :---: |
| Cake | class | The base class, and in this instance, a
superclass of IceCreamCake |
| IceCreamCake | class | a subclass of Cake. Can
also be said to _extend_ the Cake class |
| myBirthdayCake | object  | an
instance of the IceCreamCake class.|

On a superficial level, you might think of
a class as a blueprint, or recipe, for a type of objects. In the same way that
you use an actual ice cream cake recipe to create a real-world ice cream cake,
you can use the `IceCreamCake` class to create an `IceCreamCake` object like
`myBirthdayCake`.

Cake recipes are of course just a set of instructions,
they're not made of flour and sugar. Similarly, the `Cake` class is not a `Cake`
object, it's just a set of instructions on how to make `Cake` objects. This may
seem like an odd aspect to highlight, but as we'll see in a moment, this
metaphor doesn't quite work with prototypal languages.

### Prototypal
Inheritance

JavaScript, as a prototype-based language, lacks the concept of
classes\*, as such the only abstraction it has at its disposal is objects. The
need to share common properties and methods across similar objects still exists
though, and JavaScript accomplishes this by designating certain objects as
__prototypes__ of others. An object will inherit all properties of its
prototype, similar to how an object in Ruby or Python inherits the properties of
the class it belongs to. Let's take a look at this in action by returning to our
example of `Cake -> IceCreamCake -> myBirthdayCake`.

<sub>*Although ES6 did
introduce the `class` syntax, it's effectively syntactical sugar over
JavaScript's prototype system, as we'll see later. </sub>

First let's define a
cake object:

```{.python .input  n=29}
var cake = {
  ingredients: ['flour','sugar','eggs','butter','baking powder', 'milk'], 
  flavor:'vanilla'
  };
```

Now let's define an IceCreamCake object that has a `ice_cream_flavor` property:

```{.python .input  n=30}
var iceCreamCake = {
  ice_cream_flavor: "chocolate"
  };
```

Right now these are just two plain ol' objects that aren't connected to each
other in any way. Let's change that by declaring that `iceCreamCake`'s prototype
is `cake`. Once we do that `iceCreamCake` will have access to `cake`'s
properties as if they were its own.

```{.python .input  n=31}
iceCreamCake.__proto__ = cake;
console.log(`The first ingredient in iceCreamCake is ${iceCreamCake.ingredients[0]}`)
```

```{.json .output n=31}
[
 {
  "name": "stdout",
  "output_type": "stream",
  "text": "The first ingredient in iceCreamCake is flour\n"
 }
]
```

Now that we have the `cake -> iceCreamCake` relationship defined we can create a
`myBirthdayCake` object that inherits from both:

```{.python .input  n=32}
var myBirthdayCake = {};
myBirthdayCake.__proto__ = iceCreamCake;
myBirthdayCake.flavor = 'strawberry';
console.log(`My birthday cake is ${myBirthdayCake.flavor} with ${myBirthdayCake.ice_cream_flavor} ice cream `)
```

```{.json .output n=32}
[
 {
  "name": "stdout",
  "output_type": "stream",
  "text": "My birthday cake is strawberry with chocolate ice cream \n"
 }
]
```

Objects designated as prototypes are still just plain 'ol objects, all that
differs is how their `prototype` property has been assigned. Let's take a look
at how our cake inheritance chain might look under this system.

| Name | Type |
Comments |
| --- | --- | --- |
| cake | object | The prototype of `iceCreamCake`
|
| iceCreamCake | object | The child of `cake`, and the prototype of
`myBirthdayCake`  |
| myBirthdayCake | object  | The child of `iceCreamCake` |
Note that our metaphor earlier about a class in Ruby being like a blueprint or
receipe doesn't really work with JavaScript prototypes. Every level of our
inheritance chain is an object. The `cake` object at the top of our chain is a
plain ol' object just like the `myBirthdayCake` object at the end. `cake` less
like a blueprint or receipe and more like a parent or grandparent.

__Super Secret Pro-Tip: Object.create()__

Creating an object and _then_
designating its prototype is kind of verbose. Here's a handy tip to do both in
one line: `Object.create()`

This:

```{.python .input}
var myBirthdayCake = {};
myBirthdayCake.__proto__ = iceCreamCake;
```

Is equivalent to:

```{.python .input  n=34}
var myBirthdayCake = Object.create(iceCreamCake);
```

__Exercise__

Create a three level inheritance chain of `Prototype -> Child-
Prototype -> Child-Object` similiar to `Cake -> IceCreamCake -> myBirthdayCake`
examples above. Be sure to include a console line or function that demonstrates
inherited properties.

### The Need for Design patterns in JavaScript

As we've mentioned before,
JavaScript lacks a lot of the abstractions present in other object-oriented
languages for structuring inheritance chains and reusing code. It doesn't have
classes, modules, structs or anything like that; all it has is objects and
functions. Also unlike many class-based languages, objects in JavaScript don't
have to be part of any class or inheritance chain. A result of this spartan
approach is that JavaScript is much more flexible and agnostic about how you
organize your code. Consequently there are a number of different patterns that
have emerged in the JS community for how to structure your inheritance. For
example, the examples you learned above illustrate part of the _Prototype
Pattern_. The next approarch we're going to look at is what's known as the
_Constructor Pattern_

## Constructor Pattern

At this point you should be familiar with constructor
functions:

```{.python .input  n=35}
function Monster(name,color){
  this.name = name;
  this.color = color;
}

var bigfoot = new Monster('bigfoot','brown');
```

If you check the `__proto__` property of any objects created from a constructor
function you'll discover that it's been set to the name of the constructor
function plus an empty object:

```{.python .input  n=36}
console.log(bigfoot.__proto__);
```

```{.json .output n=36}
[
 {
  "name": "stdout",
  "output_type": "stream",
  "text": "Monster {}\n"
 }
]
```

All functions have a special `prototype` property in addition to their
`__proto__` property.  A function's `prototype` is the object instance that will
become the prototype for all objects created using this function as a
constructor. By default it's empty, but it's not hard to add any properties you
want to it, which all child objects will then inherit, just like any
prototype/child relationship.

```{.python .input  n=37}
Monster.prototype.eyes = 2;

console.log(bigfoot.__proto__);
console.log(bigfoot.eyes);
```

```{.json .output n=37}
[
 {
  "name": "stdout",
  "output_type": "stream",
  "text": "Monster { eyes: 2 }\n2\n"
 }
]
```

As you can see, because of the nature of inheritance, editing a constructor's
`prototype` affects all child objects, even those already created. 


###
Approximating classes in JavaScript

By using constructor functions and
prototypes together you can kinda create a pseudo-class:

```{.python .input  n=38}
function Monster(name,color){
    this.name = name;
    this.color = color;
};
Monster.prototype.greet = function(){
    console.log("Hello, I'm " + this.name);
};

var wolfman = new Monster('Harry','brown');
wolfman.greet();
```

```{.json .output n=38}
[
 {
  "name": "stdout",
  "output_type": "stream",
  "text": "Hello, I'm Harry\n"
 }
]
```

It may not be pretty, but the code above provides much the same functionality as
a class in a more traditionally object-oriented language like Ruby.* The
`Monster` function works similarly to an `initialize` method in Ruby classes.
You use it to define properties and functions unique to each specific object
created. The `prototype` is then where you define any class properties and
functions that should be shared amongst all child objects. 

<sub>Check out
[this link](https://gist.github.com/pca2/98a795d0ebdde9f4ba6b63ccd85fba3f) for
how the above code might look in Ruby.</sub>

__Exercise__

Using the above code as an example, create a `Person` constructor
with at least one function on its `prototype`. Afterwards, create a child object
that demonstrates the shared function.

### Multi-level Inheritance with the Constructor Pattern

So the above example
works is approximating a basic class, but in order to achieve multi-level
inheritance similar to the `Cake -> IceCreamCake -> myBirthdayCake` example we
used above, we'll need to make a few changes to our code. Let's try making a
`Goblin` class that extends `Monster`

```{.python .input  n=39}
function Goblin(name,color,weapon){
    Monster.call(this,name,color);
    this.weapon = weapon;
    
}
Goblin.prototype = Object.create(Monster.prototype);
Goblin.prototype.constructor = Goblin;

var osborn = new Goblin('Osborn','Green','Bombs');

osborn.greet();
```

```{.json .output n=39}
[
 {
  "name": "stdout",
  "output_type": "stream",
  "text": "Hello, I'm Osborn\n"
 }
]
```

There's three key lines above that establish the parent/child relationship
between `Monster` and `Goblin`. 

- `Monster.call(this,name,color)` (line 2)
The `Goblin` function is a constructor just like the `Monster` function. As a
extension of `Monster` it also needs to run the `Monster` constructor, this is
accomplished with the `Monster.call` line. In addition to `name` and `color`
from `Monster` you can add any additional properties you want to pass in, such
as `weapon`, and it'll be added to any child objects. 
   Hopefully you'll
recall how the `call` function works from our previous section on constructors
and the `this` keyword. It allows you to call a function and manually specify
the context in which it will run, which affects any `this` keywords used.
   The
`this` keyword in constructor functions generally refer to any new objects
created, `Monster.call(this,name,color)` is no exception. We're saying that the
first thing the `Goblin` function should do is run the `Monster` function on the
new object being created.
   
  If you're familiar with the `super` method in
Ruby, you can think of this line as serving a similar purpose.


-
`Goblin.prototype = Object.create(Monster.prototype)` (line 6)
    
    This
line also contains some elements you should recognize. As we learned above, a
function's prototype is the object instance that will become the prototype for
all objects created using this function as a constructor. `Object.create`
creates a new object with the parameter object set as the prototype. So
essentially we're saying that the  `Goblin` prototype should inherit everything
from the `Monster` prototype as well. This is how the `Osborn` object also has
access to the `greet` function added to the `Monster` prototype. This
relationship of course does not prevent us from adding unique properties to the
`Goblin` prototype. 
   
   
- `Goblin.prototype.constructor = Goblin` (line 7)
This line is something you may not have encountered before. `constructor` is a
hidden property that all JavaScript objects have by default. It returns a
reference to the constructor function that created the object in question. When
working with multi-level inheritance in the constructor pattern, the
`constructor` property can be a handy way of checking the constructor of a given
object, which serves a similar role as checking an object's class in a more
traditionally object-oriented language. The catch is that when we set the
`Goblin` prototype to `Monster.prototype` we also set the `constructor` to
`Monster`. As a result we have to manually set it to `Goblin`, which is what
we're doing here.


__Exercise__

Using what you've learned above create a
`Class -> Subclass -> ChildObject` inheritance chain with at least one function.
Use whatever real-life model you want. Some ideas: `Car -> Convertible` or
`Goblin -> Hobgoblin`

### Class Syntax: Prototypal Inheritance with a thin candy-shell

You now know
how to replicate much of the functionality of classes using JavaScript's
constructor functions and prototypes. However, it's important to remember that
__JavaScript still does not posses a true class system__. As we'll soon see, the
`class` syntax introduced in ES6 is essentially just syntatic sugar over the
constructor and prototype syntax we've examined. This is why I wanted to
demonstrate the older syntax before diving into the `class` keyword.

The
following code samples are effectively identical:

__Class syntax__

```{.python .input}
class Monster {
  constructor(name,color){
    this.name = name;
    this.color = color;
  }
  greet(){
    console.log("Hello, I'm " + this.name);
  }
}

class Goblin extends Monster{
  constructor(name,color,weapon){
    super(name,color);
    this.weapon = weapon;
  }
}

```

__Constructor Syntax__

```{.python .input}
function Monster(name,color){
    this.name = name;
    this.color = color;
};
Monster.prototype.greet = function(){
    console.log("Hello, I'm " + this.name);
};

function Goblin(name,color,weapon){
    Monster.call(this,name,color);
    this.weapon = weapon;
    
}
Goblin.prototype = Object.create(Monster.prototype);
Goblin.prototype.constructor = Goblin;
```

Let's break down each of the key actions here:

- The `constructor` function
that leads off the `Monster` class is equivalent to the `Monster` constructor
function that starts our constructor syntax example
- The `greet` function in
the body of the `Monster` class gets added to the `Monster` prototype, just like
line 5 of the constructor syntax example
- When we define `Goblin` as an
extension of the `Monster` class on line 11 it automatically sets the `Goblin`
prototype and constructor for us, meaning we don't have to set them manually, as
we did on line 14 and line 15 of the constructor syntax example
- The
`super(name,color)` on line 13 of the class syntax example is roughly equivalent
to the `Monster.call(this,name,color);` on line l0 of the constructor syntax
example

__Mixing Old and New__

Because the class syntax is just syntatic sugar over the
prototype system, you can frequently mix the two styles. For example, if you
wanted to add another function to the `Monster` class after your initial
definition the easiest might be to use the old prototype syntax:

```{.python .input}
Monster.prototype.sleep = function(){
  constole.log("zzzzz")
};
```

__When to use class syntax__

If you're following the constructor pattern the
class syntax is a lot cleaner and easier to read. So when would you want to use
the older syntax? Well as part of ES6, it's not considered to have 100% adoption
yet, so if you're writing plain JavaScript, and can't guarantee that all your
users will have up-to-date browsers, it may be safer to use the older syntax
still. 

If you're working in a node app, chances are you'll be working with a
transpiler like [Babel](https://babeljs.io/), which can automatically convert
your ES6 code to more universally compatible code.

__Exercise__

Take the multi-level inheritance code you wrote in the previous
example and refactor it using class syntax

## 5: Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE)

Because Javascript doesn't
have explicit techniques for setting privacy and access levels, certain
approaches have been developed to create effective privacy controls through
certain patterns and workarounds. One such technique is known as the immediately
invoked function expression or IIFE (Pronounced 'ifey')

Here's a template:

```{.python .input}
(function () {
    // code goes here
})();
```

Although that might look a bit scary, all it really is is a function that's
immediately run, and not stored in memory for later use.

Here's a (slightly
contrived) example:

```{.python .input  n=40}
(function (){
var secret_number = Math.floor(Math.random() * 101);
console.log(`Psst! The secret number is ${secret_number}`) 
})()
```

```{.json .output n=40}
[
 {
  "name": "stdout",
  "output_type": "stream",
  "text": "Psst! The secret number is 16\n"
 }
]
```

The above code is similar to the following:

```{.python .input  n=41}
var log_secret_number = function (){
var secret_number = Math.floor(Math.random() * 101);
  console.log(`Psst! The secret number is ${secret_number}`) 
};
log_secret_number();
```

```{.json .output n=41}
[
 {
  "name": "stdout",
  "output_type": "stream",
  "text": "Psst! The secret number is 8\n"
 }
]
```

So why use an IIFE? Well they can offer a few advantages in the right
circumstances:

1. __Privacy__: In the non-IIFE example immediately above,
`log_secret_number` is exposed in the global name space, meaning that any other
global object could call it again, which you probably don't want. Because it is
immediately invoked you ensure it's invoked once and only once. Also because the
`secret_number` variable is scoped to the IIFE function, it can't be accessed by
anything else.
2. __Memory/Performance__: The `log_secret_number` function is
now in memory forever, even though it's not needed again. IIFEs are immediately
cleaned up after use, freeing up memory.
3. __Namespace__: Now that you've
defined a `log_secret_number` function in the global namespace, there's always
the possibility of collusion with another library or developer's work. Because
nothing is exposed outside of the IIFE you ensure against this.

__Exercise__ 

Write an IIFE statement of your own

# 6: Spread Operator

The spread operator (...) expands enumerables like Arrays
to allow for easier manipulation of their content.

```{.python .input  n=42}
var a = [1,2,3];
console.log(a);
```

```{.json .output n=42}
[
 {
  "name": "stdout",
  "output_type": "stream",
  "text": "[ 1, 2, 3 ]\n"
 }
]
```

```{.python .input  n=43}
console.log(...a);
```

```{.json .output n=43}
[
 {
  "name": "stdout",
  "output_type": "stream",
  "text": "1 2 3\n"
 }
]
```

This may not seem that powerful, but actually makes it much easier to manipulate
and edit arrays. For example, in ES5, the easiest way to concatenate two arrays
is probably to use the concat function:

```{.python .input  n=44}
var a = [1,2,3];
var b = [4,5,6];
var a_and_b = a.concat(b);
console.log(a_and_b);
```

```{.json .output n=44}
[
 {
  "name": "stdout",
  "output_type": "stream",
  "text": "[ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 ]\n"
 }
]
```

Here's how you'd do that with the spread operator it:

```{.python .input  n=45}
var a = [1,2,3];
var b = [4,5,6];
var a_and_b = [...a,...b];
```

Reordering or editing an array also becomes easier:

```{.python .input  n=46}
var a = [1,2,3];
var a = [0,...a,4,5];
console.log(a);
```

```{.json .output n=46}
[
 {
  "name": "stdout",
  "output_type": "stream",
  "text": "[ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]\n"
 }
]
```

__Objects__

Support for the spread operator has also been proposed for objects.
It's not officially supported yet, but is widely expected to become part of an
update to the language soon. In the meantime, you can use it if you use a
transpiler such as Babel.

The neat thing about the spread operator for objects
is that it makes it real easy to clone objects, or make clones of object that
differ slightly. Check it:

```{.python .input  n=47}
var me = {
  name: "ME",
  age: 37
}
var me_clone = {...me};
console.log(me_clone);
```

```{.json .output n=47}
[
 {
  "name": "stdout",
  "output_type": "stream",
  "text": "{ name: 'ME', age: 37 }\n"
 }
]
```

```{.python .input  n=48}
var you = {...me,name:'you'}
console.log(you);
```

```{.json .output n=48}
[
 {
  "name": "stdout",
  "output_type": "stream",
  "text": "{ name: 'you', age: 37 }\n"
 }
]
```
